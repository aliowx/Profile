# Neural Scroll Project: Predicting Brain Scrolls with Swin Transformer

Welcome to the **Neural Scroll Project**, where cutting-edge neuroscience meets state-of-the-art vision transformers to uncover hidden structures within the brain ‚Äî what we call "**brain scrolls**". These latent spatiotemporal patterns encode deep layers of cognition, memory, and sensory processing.

## üß† What is a Brain Scroll?

A **brain scroll** is a metaphorical term we use to describe highly structured, multi-dimensional neural activity patterns that emerge over time ‚Äî like a scroll being unrolled. These patterns often represent:

- Episodic memory sequences
- Predictive cognition loops
- Neural priors shaped by experience and environment

Our goal is to **predict** and **decode** these patterns in real-time using advanced machine learning architectures ‚Äî particularly, the **Swin Transformer**.

## üîç Why Swin Transformer?

The **Swin Transformer** (Shifted Window Transformer) is a hierarchical vision transformer architecture that excels in learning from spatially localized features. Originally designed for computer vision, its properties make it **ideal for decoding dynamic brain activity** represented as high-dimensional time-series maps (e.g., fMRI slices or MEG signals over time).

Key advantages:

- **Local-global context fusion** through window shifting
- **Hierarchical feature learning** like CNNs, but fully attention-driven
- Excellent at **temporal prediction** when adapted with positional encodings

## üß™ Our Experimental Pipeline

1. **Data Input**: Preprocessed fMRI/EEG tensors shaped as 3D arrays (Time √ó Channels √ó Regions)
2. **Embedding**: Patch-based embedding of time-series slices
3. **Swin Transformer**: Multi-stage encoder layers with shifted attention windows
4. **Prediction Head**: Forecasting latent scroll patterns in future timesteps

### Sample Architecture

# üî• python

    class BrainScrollPredictor(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.swin = SwinTransformer3D(...)
            self.head = nn.Linear(...)

        def forward(self, x):
            features = self.swin(x)
            return self.head(features)
